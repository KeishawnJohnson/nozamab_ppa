#What is it?

Nozamab Ppa is a CLI app that used the users preferences to purchase common items needed for summer fun.

#Tech used!

*MySql
*Inquirer

#How it works
After opening the application the app is going to list every item it has in it's inventory.
Then it will ask the user what they want to buy and how much.
If its possible then everything will go through without a problem. However if anything isnt
feesible, such as; that items doesnt exist or we simply dont have enough, then the app will respond with an error message.
